# illytoolz
A community built illytools replacement, which enhances the MMORTS illyriad with various tools and UI improvements.

Currently starting development, updates will follow soon.

Once functional, a bookmark like the one below could be used to load illytoolz.
javascript:$("body").append('<script id="illytoolz" style="display: none;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Illyriad-Community/illytoolz/master/illytoolz.js"></script>');
